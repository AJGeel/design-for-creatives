The Eindhoven Museum does not only exploit the (Pre)historic village (which, by the way, will be the background for the soon-to-be-released Dutch film epos on Redbad, the last king of the “Friesen” in the 8th century), but also owns a collection of art and historic objects. The museum however doesn’t own a permanent exhibition space, so that they have adopted a strategy for the upcoming years that is centered around organizing pop-up exhibitions. These exhibitions are scheduled to take place at events where already a lot of people gather, such as Eindhoven Culinair, Dutch Design Week, Strijp festival, etc. but also on a more limited scale at community centers, schools, etc. This implies that exhibitions need to be flexible and adaptable in terms of size and content to the intended venue and audience. Both professional designers hired by the museum and design teams from our department have made/are making proposals for installations that could be part of such a pop-up exhibition. Such installations need to be assessed in terms of 3 aspects: 1) how well do they agree with the strategic goal of “Museum in the City”, which is to connect past, present and future developments in the Eindhoven region, 2) how well can museum staff who are often not technically trained (especially not in ICT), but who have insight in the collection and the practice of making exhibitions, use the proposed installations to create an exposition, and 3) how will the public experience the proposed installations. The project can build on experiences gained in earlier student projects (the first theme was “Food” and will be shown for the first time at DDW, the theme that you will be designing for is “Mobility”).
