## Introduction

We want to aid Eindhoven Museum's (EM's) vision on informing the crowds about Eindhoven's past, present and future by introducing a novel user experience based on gamification. A competitive, multi-player quizzing activity challenges- and informs EM's visitors about historic developments around the city. This game activity should be 'plug-and-play', engaging and competitive. 
This activity can be either of two forms: a single 'game-board' interface and a distributed, multi-user interface. The principle of both interfaces are alike: a quizzing activity that discloses Eindhoven's past in a competitive, interactive way. 
Succes criteria for this concept include: *Quality of Engagement, Informativeness* and *a platform for sharing/discussion*.
